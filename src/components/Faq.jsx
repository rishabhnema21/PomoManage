      question: "What is the Pomodoro Technique?",
      answer:
        "The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method where you work in focused intervals (usually 25 minutes) followed by short breaks. It helps improve focus, reduce mental fatigue, and boost productivity.",

      question: "How long is a Pomodoro session?",
      answer:
        "A standard Pomodoro session is 25 minutes of focused work, followed by a 5-minute break. After four Pomodoros, you take a longer break of 15â€“30 minutes.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I customize the timer durations?",

      question: "Do I need to sign up to use the timer?",

      question: "Will my progress be saved?",

      question: "How is this different from a regular timer?",
